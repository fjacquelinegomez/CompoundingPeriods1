# CompoundingPeriods1
Software that uses C++ in where the user enters the compounding periods and the program will output the final balance.

The user inputs the number of interest compounding periods, if users inputs 1 it is compunded annually, 2 if it is semi-anually and 4 if it is compounded quarterly. The program will use the equation A = P(1+r/n)^(nt) to find the final balance, where 'P' is the principal amount, 'r' is the interest rate and 'n' is the compounding periods and finally 't' is the number of years. The principal amount, interest amount, and the number of years will be inputted from a file.
I used Math functions such as pow() for the equation, setfill() for the dots to appear in the output, setw() for the numbers to line up and setprecision() for the right amount of decimals to appear in the output.
